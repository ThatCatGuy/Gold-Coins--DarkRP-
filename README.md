This is a nice little addon that allows Gold Coins to be spawned in via the Q Menu and collected by users. There is 4 Convars that can be changed so it can give random amounts of money on collection or a set amount read below.

## Credits
**CODE BLUE** https://steamcommunity.com/id/codeblue for original code following one of his fantastic tutorials. May he rest in piece. Thank you for all you gave to the community.

## How to spawn/equip
Spawn from menu: Open Q Menu go to Entities -> CatGuy Sweps -> Gold Coins

## How to use
By default the amount is **random** between **500** and **2000**.
You can set the minimum coin value by setting **coin_min_value xxx** in your server console.
You can set the maximum coin value by setting **coin_max_value xxx** in your server console.
You can set the money you get on collection to a actual value by setting **coin_random 0** and **coin_value xxx** this will then give this amount per coin to set it back to the radom min/max set **coin_random 1**
